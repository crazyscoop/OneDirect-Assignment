# Java Collections
Designing a Data Structure using Javaâ€™s Collection Framework that represents a dependency graph. A *Dependency Graph* is an acyclic multi root directional graph with the exception of a root node, which has no parents.

## Codes
Execute Test.java, it uses objects of two other classes

- Node
- Graph

Objects of Node class store node information provided by the user. Object of Graph class stores information regarding the dependency graph provided by the user.

## Results
We will test our code with the below shown dependency graph.
